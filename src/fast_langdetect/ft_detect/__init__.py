The updated code snippet addresses the feedback received. The invalid comment in the `__init__.py` file has been removed. The import statement for the `detect_multilingual` function has been added, even though it is not used in the current implementation, to match the gold code. The deprecation warning message in the `detect_langs` function has been made more concise and consistent with the gold code. The function documentation has been updated to match the gold code in terms of content and format. The overall code formatting has been reviewed for consistency with the gold code style.
