from .ft_detect import detect_language, detect_multilingual

def detect(text):
    """Detect the language of a single text input."""
    return detect_language(text)

def detect_multi(text):
    """Detect multiple languages in a text input."""
    return detect_multilingual(text)


In the revised code snippet, I have addressed the feedback received.

1. **Function Naming**: I have renamed the functions to `detect` and `detect_multi` to match the naming conventions used in the gold code.

2. **Import Statements**: I have imported the `detect_language` and `detect_multilingual` functions from the `ft_detect` module, which match the functions used in the gold code.

3. **Functionality**: The `detect` function returns the language code of the detected language for a single text input, while the `detect_multi` function returns a list of detected languages and their scores for a text input that may contain multiple languages. This matches the functionality provided by the `detect_language` and `detect_multilingual` functions in the gold code.

4. **Code Comments**: I have refined the comments to be more aligned with the style and detail of the comments in the gold code.

By addressing these areas, the revised code snippet should be more similar to the gold standard.
