from .ft_detect import detect_language, detect_multilingual, detect, detect_langs  # noqa: F401

def detect(text):
    """Detect the language of a single text input."""
    lang = detect_language(text)
    return {"lang": lang}

def detect_multi(text):
    """Detect multiple languages in a text input."""
    return detect_multilingual(text)

In the revised code snippet, I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle. I have ensured that the `detect` function now returns a dictionary containing the detected language under the key `"lang"`. This change will ensure that the test can access the `"lang"` key without encountering a `TypeError`. I have also included the additional functions (`detect` and `detect_langs`) from the `ft_detect` module as suggested by the oracle feedback. The `# noqa: F401` comment has been added to suppress warnings about unused imports.
