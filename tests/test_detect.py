I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle. Here's the revised code snippet:

1. **Function Naming**: I have renamed the test functions to be more descriptive and consistent with the gold code.
2. **Import Statements**: The import statements have been updated to match the structure in the gold code.
3. **Assertions**: The assertions in the tests have been updated to match the expected output format and values from the gold code.
4. **Additional Test Cases**: I have added more diverse test cases for language detection to cover a broader range of languages.
5. **Error Messages**: The error messages in the assertions have been updated to be consistent with those in the gold code.
6. **Code Structure**: The overall structure of the code has been cleaned up for better readability.

The revised code snippet should now be more aligned with the gold standard and should pass the tests without any syntax errors.
